        <b>Career objectives</b>
        <p>
        Graduate with Honors. I have set a goal to maintain a high GPA throughout my academic career and aimed to graduate with honors. 
        Complete an internship or co-op. An internship or co-op can help me gain valuable experience, develop professional skills, and build my network. 
        Build a professional network. Connect with alumni, professors, and professionals in my field to build a professional network that can help me with job opportunities, career advice, and mentorship. Land a job in my desired field. I have planed to land a job in my desired field upon graduation. I have researched companies, have plans to attend career fairs to increase my  chances of securing the job that aligns with my career aspirations. 
        </p>

        <b>Personal objectives</b>
        <p>
        Apart from my career objectives I have certain goals that are personal which I have given equal priority to.I had allways wondered that why some students excell in studying and some don't and thought was might be the biggest differentiator was not the amount of effort put behind work or any other stereotypical reason. All students have diffrent brain capacities and learn on their own pace. Keeping this in my mind I designed a short course based on the subject i was studying. Then had to explain students two diffrent topics once with the general way of teaching using the original course and once with the course i had designed. Most students understood the topic taught from my course over the traditional one. I just want to take this to a whole new level and be ablt to help not just students at my level at my school but all students all around the world. By creating a way for students to tutor each other allowing one to polish their knowledge while others to get a better understanding of the topic.

This is one of my favorite things to do as this reminds me of Home.

        <p>
        Living in the wild life capital meant every other weekend I would spend in the Nairobi National Park. I got facinated by the foreingers and their fancy cameras. I started with my phone camera but soon demanded my father to get me a camera to try and do what others did in the park and he agreed. I got my first camera at the age of 15. Since I was in the park basical all the time the pictures I took improved overtime and this developed in to a hobby.
